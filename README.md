# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction (TensorFlow)

Machine learning project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using a deep neural network (DNN) built with **TensorFlow**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
The goal is to train a supervised classification model on the Titanic dataset and explore which features (like age, sex, and passenger class) most strongly affect survival.

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing with Pandas  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model building using TensorFlow / Keras  
- Training, evaluation, and interpretation of model results

## 📊 Key Findings
After analyzing the data, we can observe that:
- Most passengers were in their 20’s or 30’s  
- The majority of passengers were **male**  
- Most traveled in **Third Class**  
- **Females had a much higher chance of survival**
